# "Monotonic Neural Network" by Joseph Sill ; Pytorch

This repository contains an implementation in Python using PyTorch of the monotonic Neural network as explained in the paper [Monotonic Neural Networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/1997/file/83adc9225e4deb67d7ce42d58fe5157c-Paper.pdf) by Joseph Sill in 1997.

The paper "Monotonic Neural Networks" by Joseph Sill presents a method for training neural networks that enforce monotonicity constraints on the output with respect to each input feature. The author defines a monotonic neural network as a neural network whose output is non-decreasing (or non-increasing) with respect to each input feature.
